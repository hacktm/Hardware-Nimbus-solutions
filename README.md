How cool would it be when somebody rings at your door, to get an instant notification on your phone? And even cooler, to be able to respond?
Fear no more, SmartDoorbell is here and does precisely that.

We connected a doorbell to a raspberry PI board.
When somebody rings, the raspberry PI sends a push notification to your phone.
At that point you can reply with a text message and the raspberry will speak it out (multilanguage support courtesy of google translate APIs) , but ony if the visitor is still near. (thx ultrasound proximity sensor)
